# Vision Statement
---

Skylink is an innovative flight-booking system designed to redefine the travel experience of Canadian users. Our primary goal is to provide an easy, customer-focused, seamless, and stress-free platform to manage every aspect of air travel from booking to boarding. We will create a unique travel experience for every customer by providing an easy and efficient way to manage personal data, real-time flight information, and a comprehensive solution for booking, check-in, and secure payments before and after the flights. Skylink is committed to transforming the Canadian travel experience.

Skylink is primarily designed to be used by both frequent and occasional travelers. It will provide every traveler the opportunity to plan their trip by exploring multiple flights and selecting the most suitable one based on their preferences and requirements. Our platform will allow users to choose and reserve their preferred seats during the booking process to create a comfortable journey experience. Our platform will provide travelers the freedom to explore various filtering such as different date suggestions, one-way or round-trip booking, and price-wise sorting to prioritize their convenience.

We offer a simple and secure method for users to manage their payments. Our user-friendly system allows users to easily log in and sign up to enable them to manage their flight plans and join the platform. Also, users may update their information seamlessly.

To streamline the journey, Skylink provides an online check-in system enabling users to bypass queues at the airline counter. Our system has a built-in component to generate a boarding pass, allowing a smooth transition from check-in to boarding gates.

Finally, to foster the best travel experience for our users, we provide users with a real-time notification system to keep them informed about their trip from the booking confirmation to arrival at their destination. Additionally, users can enhance their journey by including various services before departure, such as in-flight meals, lounge access, priority boarding, wifi and entertainment packages.

The value of Skylink lies in its commitment to making air travel accessible, stress-free, and rewarding for all users. By offering a simplified and intuitive interface, users can effortlessly log in, manage their profiles, search for flights, book their journeys, and complete secure payments, all within a single system. The inclusion of a reminder system provides the quickest and most real-time updates that agents might not deliver on time. By utilizing our user-friendly check-in and boarding pass program, users can save valuable time before the trip. Skylink also enhances user experience by providing innovative seat booking and various add-ons to construct a personalized and memorable trip.

The project will be considered successful based on four criteria. Firstly, we aim to win the userâ€™s heart and this will be evident by becoming the top travel app on Google Play Store and reaching one million downloads in our first year.  Also, we want to make sure that fewer than 10% of users stop using the app in the first year. Thirdly, a critical achievement is to meet a 90% success rate in providing users with real-time flight updates and notifications for any changes to their booked flights. Lastly, our goal is to attract approximately 40% of Canadian travelers using our system to fulfill their travel needs and ensure their satisfaction.
